# Milestone 1
Each team will submit a brief proposal for the project stating the real-world problems (not technology solution) you are trying to address. An important question to answer in this proposal is why it is important to address? In other words, why it matters? If you want to design a new application to replace an existing one, you must explain why the existing one needs to be improved or replaced.

# International Student Manual (ISM) Web Application / App (Pace Centric at first)
Applied to Universities, received I-20, applied for visa, received visa. Ready to fly!!!!!! 
Well, it is a roller coaster ride when you are doing something outside of your comfort zone or moving to country that is totally new and starting fresh.
Moving abroad for international students comes with many challenges and you must be in a race from day one, we were at the receiving end of it, and I would say it is thrilling experience to some and headache to many. Below are few of the challenges one faces
1.	Accommodations*
2.	College Events/ Job fairs
3.	Driver’s License
4.	SSN
5.	On Campus jobs
6.	Health Insurance*
7.	Interview preparations
8.	Alumni’s 
9.	Discounts
10.	Traveling options
11.	Monthly and yearly living cost 
12.	Immigration questions
13.	Immunization form

These are few of the stress areas which majority of the student’s faced issues with, which we found out using our WhatsApp group. Accommodation and health insurance are most important ones that we noticed followed by on campus jobs.
# Why it is important to address?
If we take accommodation for reference, the challenges we faced we, how do we trust that the person we are talking to is genuine? Many a times we were asked for application fees and since we had no SSN, we were asked for guarantors and for higher security deposit. Sometimes the person was never there. How do we transfer the money from India for booking the apartment? Do we know someone who can do it on our behalf and can trust us to repay them this big amount? How do we contact foreign numbers from India? All we had to rely on was the video calls we had for viewing the apartment and paying amount in $1000+ dollars, sometimes to find out the video was old or some of the amenities are not present, which were seen in the video, or the photos showed furnished apartments, but we get a blank canvas when we arrive.
Other major issue is with the health insurance and on campus jobs. When it comes to health insurance which for some is very expensive the ones that college offers, so what are the alternatives available and approved by the university. Since the university Is right in the center of the city with a small campus and with student strength so strong, how or what are the strategies to obtain on campus jobs. Also, other important stress point is finding internship (at a later stage) and how to network with the right person (as International students require sponsorships). These are just few of the pointers stating why it is important to address.
Once we address the important points, it becomes much easier to focus on the real things like studying and networking and most important of all enjoying the new country and exploring it.

# Why it matters?
“Don’t waste your pain, use it to help others.” – Rick Warren
We want to make it simple for the upcoming international students, so that they do not have to go through all the hardships that one faces and if they must face it, they always have someone to help them. 
By providing this platform, we are trying to address the important stress points and hope to make it a smooth ride and so that they can really enjoy the experience of visiting a new country away from their loved ones. (Home away from home).
